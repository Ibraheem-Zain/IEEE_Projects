Simple library System.



It is a simple project system for library to be used by the admin and the user.

The admin has the all rights ,so they are protected with a password.

The admin able to implement four functions while the user can only use two.

The four functions are:-

1) add more than one book at once.   (for the admin only)
2) clear more than one book at once.   (for the admin only)
3) search about a book in alphabetical.
4) shows all library's books.

All functions return the user to  the main function to repeat the process.

here is the illustration for the project with a PPT.
